SQA Engine
==========

Library for high-performance audio playback that makes sure the audio gets out the door exactly when you tell it to.
Still in development, and subject to violent, earth-shattering change. See the [SQA devlog](http://pro.theta.eu.org/2017/01/02/sqa-devlog-1.html) for more information!

This will be used in [SQA](https://github.com/eeeeeta/sqa) in "the future" (by the time you're reading this, it may already
be used...), hence the title.
