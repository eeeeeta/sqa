Library containing basic [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) bindings for Rust.
Still in development, and subject to violent, earth-shattering change.
Currently, this library only supports extracting audio data, and may be unsuitable for your use-case.

These will be used in [SQA](https://github.com/eeeeeta/sqa) in "the future" (by the time you're reading this, they may already
be used...), hence the title.
